mkdir FinalTest
touch File.txt
touch Command.txt
git add InfoFile1
git add InfoFile2
git commit -m "Insert Text here"
git config user.name "hdavies3_INFO"
git add Command.txt
git status
I learned that Command.txt and MyFile.txt have been modified and that it shows that Command.txt is in the staging area from earlier, therefore it is not up to date to it's current contents.
